Things to address in 1.2.1:

1.  Right now if a player has an active timer and that timer start command is ran again, it just shows text as if the timer was restarted, though it does still maintain the original timer.  This is not a functional issue but more of a sanity/aesthetic one.  The goal is to change the text so its clear that time specified timer is already running, and move the text to config,yml.

2.  When running timer start commands, you can currently just type in any arbitrary timer ID even if its not specified in the config, and it will work and write to the DB.  Fix so if its not a timer called out in the config, it will error out (error text should be put in config.yml)

3.  Check text output when `timer 2` is started when `timer 1` is active.  It should be clear that one timer has been cancelled.  Move message to config.yml

4.  Change placeholder %ztimer_active_<timerId>% to return yes/no instead of true/false

5.  Make a name placeholder for the active timer

6.  Make active placeholders global instead of per player 

6.  Maybe not for 1.2.1 (1.2.2 or 1.3) consider a separate messages.yml
