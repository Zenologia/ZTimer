Changes in v1.1

Persistent pending teleports

Players who disconnect during a run now get a pending teleport recorded to plugins/ZTimer/pending_teleports.yml so the teleport survives server restarts.
Optional relog commands

Per-timer relog-commands can be configured (executed as console on the player's next join). Placeholders supported: %player%, %player_uuid%.
